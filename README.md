# Capacitive Svelte

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte and Capacitor.

## Recommended IDE Setup

Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the
[extensions recommended for the workspace](./.vscode/extensions.json). Make sure
the [settings](./.vscode/settings.json) aren't obscured by your user settings in
any way.

## Setting up the environment

1. Install Node version 18. You can use asdf to install using `asdf install`
2. (optional) Install the dependencies to run Storybook's test runner with
   `sudo npx playwright install-deps`
3. Install NPM packages with `npm install`
4. Setup your Android development environment
   1. install android studio or android command line tools
5. Setup your iOS development environment
   1. install Xcode
   2. `npx cap open ios`
   3. Go to App > Signing & Capabilities and choose a signing certificate

## Setting up the environment (with docker)

This currently works only for android on linux.

1. Install docker;
2. Run `make up` on the project root folder, this will create the container and
   attach you to it.
3. Run `npm install`;

Now you are ready to go =).

## Running

```sh
# For development
npm run dev         # Runs the app in hot reload mode
npm run dev:android # Runs the app in hot reload mode on an android device or emulator
npm run dev:ios     # Runs the app in hot reload mode on an ios device or emulator
npm run storybook   # Runs storybook in hot reloading mode

# For deployment
npm run build           # Builds the app into the dist folder
npm run preview         # Runs the built app
npm run preview:android # Runs the built app on an android device or emulator
npm run preview:ios     # Runs the built app on an ios device or emulator
npm run storybook-build # Builds a static storybook site into storybook-static
```

To run storybook from the static folder you'll have to host the storybook-static
folder.

## Testing

You may run two kinds of tests:

```sh
# run once variants
npm run test:vitest # Runs tests in *.test.ts files
npm run test:storybook # Runs tests in storybook stories using test runner

# watch variants (will rerun changed tests automatically)
npm run test:vitest-watch # Runs tests in *.test.ts files
npm run test:storybook-watch # Runs tests in storybook stories using test runner
```

## Linting and Formatting

The project comes with a pre-loaded eslint configuration, prettier and
svelte-check. The commands are as follows:

```sh
npm run format # Formats all files using prettier
npm run lint-fix # Fixes all autofixable issues detected by eslint
npm run format-check # Checks if it's formatter correctly using prettier
npm run lint # Checks if the files are okay according to eslint
npm run check # Checks if the files are okay according to svelte-check
```

## Testing everything

You may want to run all the tests to check if the project is following the
formatter, linter and has no failing tests. You can do that with the command
`npm run check-all`

## Deploying

Set `version` and `build` to the corresponding version and build number of the
app and run `npm run update-version` to update the app version and build number
and the follow the guides below:

- [Android](https://docs.vlgi.com/team/dev/flows/mobile-deploy/android-deploy/)
- [iOS](https://docs.vlgi.com/team/dev/flows/mobile-deploy/ios-deploy/)

## Snippets

This project has defined some snippets to help with svelte and stories
boilerplate.

### Snippets for svelte file

- `component`: Create Svelte Component with TS and SCSS
- `script`: Create Svelte Script tag with TS lang
- `style`: Create Svelte Style tag with SCSS lang

### Snippets for Typescript file

- `story`: Create a story for a component.
- `story-template`: Create a story for a component with story template, to reuse
  common configs.

## Technical details

### vitest and @storybook/jest

Vitest is a testing tool like Jest, but it is optimized to vite projects. It
uses the same build pipeline as the project and simplifies a lot the
configuration and possible conflicts. However, the incredible play function in
stories granted by the Storybook Interactions addon is only usable with the
@storybook/jest package.

Given the situation it is recommended to use Vitest when in a test file and the
storybook Jest when creating play functions.

Create play functions to automate the process of interact with the component
you're developing, and to let documented the component interactions.

Use vitest to test your components, to guarantee that they work properly.

### Handling events in svelte stories

Svelte Storybook will refuse to handle Svelte events and add automatically the
actions, so you would have to manually add each event with a
`action("on:<event name>")` handler. However, in the next paragraph we describe
how to add the mock call for testing. The mock call will produce an action, so
we just recommend adding a call to `args.event_click` in the template.

It is quite hard to find exactly how storybook gives events mock handlers as
args in Svelte. Storybook will give you all the event handle mocks with the name
`event_<event name>`, so an event handled by `on:click` would be accessible by
`args.event_click`. This is the only way to consistently test events being
dispatched using interactions addon. If you try to instantiate a separate mock
to handle and you add it to the template, expecting for it to be called will
fail.

The last quirk is that the Template's slot props in Svelte CSF are badly typed,
so whenever you try to add the mock handlers to the events you will get a unsafe
assignment with any value. My recommendation is to disable only that linting
rule for the Template definition.

### Routing

We use [Svelte SPA router](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/svelte-spa-router).
Just look through their documentation for more info.

### Ionic?

This project is Capacitor only, not an Ionic project. We only added the
ionic.config.json and the cli package so we could run the app as a livereload
app. You may add ionic, but we do not recommend as it is not really worth it.
